## Firmware installation

The boards you get from us(Melexis) for the I2C STICK are pre-programmed.  
Meaning that this information is only needed when you buy yourself from off the shelve resources or you want to upgrade firmware.

### Instruction

1. Download the `UF2` file from the pre-compiled list below.
1. Press both `RST` and `BOOT` button on the MCU at the same time.
1. Release only the `RST` button.
1. Then moments later release also the `BOOT` button.
1. Now a flash drive should appear.
1. drag and drop (copy) the `UF2` file to the root of that drive.
1. Once this copy is finished, you are ready to use i2c-stick!
